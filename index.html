		<h2>The Functional Machine Calculus II: Semantics</h2>
		Chris Barrett, Willem Heijltjes, Guy McCusker<br>
		Accepted for publication at CSL 2023<br>
		Abstract
		<p> 
		The Functional Machine Calculus (FMC), recently introduced by the authors, is a generalization of the lambda-calculus which may faithfully encode the effects of higher-order mutable store, I/O and probabilistic/non-deterministic input. Significantly, it remains confluent and can be simply typed in the presence of these effects. In this paper, we explore the denotational semantics of the FMC. We have three main contributions: first, we argue that its syntax -- in which both effects and lambda-calculus are realised using the same syntactic constructs -- is semantically natural, corresponding closely to the structure of a Scott-style domain theoretic semantics. Second, we show that simple types confer strong normalization by extending Gandy's proof for the lambda-calculus, including a small simplification of the technique. Finally, we show that the typed FMC (without considering the specifics of encoded effects), modulo an appropriate equational theory, is a complete language for Cartesian closed categories.

		<h2>A Subatomic Proof System for Decision Trees</h2>
		Chris Barrett, <a href="http://alessio.guglielmi.name/">Alessio Guglielmi</a>

		Published in ToCL 2022<br>
		Abstract<br>
		<p>
		We design a proof system for propositional classical logic that integrates two languages for Boolean functions: standard conjunction-disjunction-negation and binary decision trees. We give two reasons to do so. The first is proof-theoretical naturalness: the system consists of all and only the inference rules generated by the single, simple, linear scheme of the recently introduced subatomic logic. Thanks to this regularity, cuts are eliminated via a natural construction. The second reason is that the system generates efficient proofs. Indeed, we show that a certain class of tautologies due to Statman, which cannot have better than exponential cut-free proofs in the sequent calculus, have polynomial cut-free proofs in our system. We achieve this by using the same construction that we use for cut elimination. In summary, by expanding the language of propositional logic, we make its proof theory more regular and generate more proofs, some of which are very efficient.
		That design is made possible by considering atoms as superpositions of their truth values, which are connected by self-dual, non-commutative connectives. A proof can then be projected via each atom into two proofs, one for each truth value, without a need for cuts. Those projections are semantically natural and are at the heart of the constructions in this paper. To accommodate self-dual non-commutativity, we compose proofs in deep inference.

		<h2>Ph.D. Thesis: On the Simply Typed Functional Machine Calculus: Categorical Semantics and Strong Normalisation</h2>
		Abstract<br>
		<p> The Functional Machine Calculus (FMC) was recently introduced as a generalization of the lambda-calculus to include higher-order global state, probabilistic and non-deterministic choice, and input and ouput, while retaining confluence. The calculus can encode both the call-by-name and call-by-value semantics of these effects. This is enabled by two independent generalizations. The first decomposes the syntax of the lambda-calculus in a way that allows for sequential composition of terms and the encoding of reduction strategies. The second paramaterizes application and abstraction in terms of `locations', which gives a unification of the operational semantics, syntax, and reduction rules of the given effects with those of the lambda-calculus.
			The FMC further comes equipped with a simple type system which restricts and captures the behaviour of effects.<br>
 
			This thesis makes two main contributions, showing that two fundamental properties of the lambda-calculus are preserved by the FMC. 
			The first is to show that the categorical semantics of the FMC, modulo an appropriate equational theory, is given by the free Cartesian closed category.
			The equational theory validated by a notion of observational equivalence. %, and decomposes beta reduction into a local, linear rule and a set of naturalities?
			The second contribution is a proof that typed FMC-terms are strongly normalising. This is an extension (and small simplification) of Gandy's proof for the lambda-calculus, which additionally emphasizes its latent operational intuition.
